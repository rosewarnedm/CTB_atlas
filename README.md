## Image repository of teaching brain cases

NB to use the key images for making annotated pathology and making reference in a document that is also part of the archive you will need to duplicate the relevant file (eg slice_001.jpg copied to slice_001_annotated.jpg) to keep the annotations out of the stack if that is what you want to do.
